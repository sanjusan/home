# /Now
This is a new page on my site, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), who came up with the idea of a “Now Page”. It gives you a glimpse into my life beyond 9to5, and it holds me accountable for making it count.

## What I'm up to right **NOW**:

* Reading [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40718726-genghis-khan-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world?from_search=true) by Jack Weatherford.
* Reading [The Tao Of Seneca](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28676323-the-tao-of-seneca?from_search=true) by Tim Ferris.
* Learning how to play the *ukelele*.
* Working on a side project to make gourmet food more accessible.
