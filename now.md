# /Now
This is a new page on my site, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), who came up with the idea of a “Now Page”. Like most everything else I do, this is an experiment.

## What I'm up to right **NOW**:

* Reading *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* by Jack Weatherford.
* Reading *The Tao Of Seneca*.
* Learning how to play the *ukelele*.
* Working on a side project to make gourmet food more accessible.
