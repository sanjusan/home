This is a new page on my site, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), who came up with the idea of a “Now Page”. Like most everything else I do, this is an experiment.

* Reading *Tools of Titans* by Tim Ferris.
* Learning how to play the *ukelele*
* Trying to host more people via couchsurfing. Giving back is so important.
* Working on a side project to help women feel better, *everyday*.
