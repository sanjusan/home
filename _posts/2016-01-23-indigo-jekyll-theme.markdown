**The problem is simple yet scary**
In 2018, there were 13.1 million clergical jobs in Japan. Due to the innate nature of keeping their feelings to themselves, the japanese are shy of open speech. Lonliness is becoming the norm of life and career growth is slow to stagnant.

**Meet Koi. A new kind of socioprofessional platform**
It will allow japanese professionals from all industries to interact with each other and discuss industry news, salaries, post job openings, ask for referrals and take polls. It is designed with anonimity and security in mind.
